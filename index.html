The Montessori School of Washington is a small, nurturing environment for children aged two to six, where the curriculum is based on the philosophy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_method" target="_new">Dr. Maria Montessori</A>. The goals of our programs are:
<!-- <a href="summer2012.htm"><img src="images/summer2012.jpg" width="160"border="0" alt="Kids at School" style="float:right;"></a> -->
<ul>
    <li>Provide opportunities for each child to be successful, creating a positive self-image. </li>
    <li>Help each child become competent, independent and self-confident and to learn to respect freedom with responsibility.</li>
    <li>Encourage each child's natural curiosity and love of learning within a structure but with flexibility.</li>
    <li>Provide natural, ungraded, vertical grouping of children so that they may learn from each other.</li>
    <li>Encourage independent study as well as group cooperation to foster self-discipline.</li>
</ul>
  The Montessori School of Washington aims to introduce children to the joy of learning at an early age and assists the child in creating an inner order. This self-discipline becomes the basis of freedom, within a framework, for children to learn through their senses according to their own timetable of growth and level of interest.
<p>
By achieving continuous success in learning experiences, the child will develop self-confidence and competence, attributes which are carried into maturity. When children acquire self-mastery and self-respect, they then respect others.
