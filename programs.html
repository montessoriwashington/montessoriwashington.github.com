The Montessori School of Washington offers early education for children aged two through six years. In the classroom, each child follows a natural progression through four categories of learning:
<p>
The <b>Practical Life Exercises</b> involve simple tasks relating to care and maintenance of each child's environment. They give each child a sense of organization and concentration, as well as an appreciation of a completed cycle of activity.
<p>
The <b>Sensorial Materials</b> help each child organize, categorize and refine the perceptions of his senses, e.g., colors, sounds, geometric shapes and relative sizes.
<p>
The <b>Language Materials</b> prepare each child for writing and reading. Children are made aware of phonetics, vocabulary and the functions of words.
<p>
In <b>Mathematics</b>, each child is exposed to concrete materials that introduce counting and the association of numbers with quantities. The program then progresses to more abstract concepts in preparation for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
<p>
MSOW's goal is to develop patterns of concentration and thoroughness in early childhood in order to produce a competent and confident learner in later years.

<p>
MSOW is proud to be able to enhance the curriculum with Subject Specialists, who lead the students in a variety of language lessons and other activities, including:

<ul><li><b>French/Spanish</b>: Most research suggests that children have a tremendous ability to learn other languages during the first six years of life. We here at MSOW nurture and enable that ability by introducing French and Spanish to our curriculum. Every Tuesday, our circle-time includes songs, stories, finger play, colors, letters, and days of the week in French. Every Thursday, our circle-time activities are done in Spanish. Older students have extended circle time on Tuesdays and Thursdays to work on additional language skills.</li>
<li><b>Music</b>: Children have a natural and basic tendency to respond to music, and at MSOW we provide ample opportunties to explore and interpret music under the guidance of our specially-trained music teachers.</li>
<li><b>Yoga</b>: Weekly yoga sessions at MSOW incorporate exercise and play using yoga poses as a springboard for exploration of many other areas such as nature, animal adaptation and behaviors, chanting, and storytelling. These sessions physically enhance chidrens' flexibility, coordination and body awareness while helping them to connect more deeply with their inner self.</li>
<li><b>Fun-Fitness</b>: MSOW's weekly Fun-Fitness session is a high-energy, excitement packed activity that brings physical, language and cognitive development to a whole new level using various props, balls, chutes, scarves, instruments, etc.</li> </ul>
